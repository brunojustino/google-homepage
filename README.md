This websites initially only uses HTML and CSS. 

I've used CSS Grid and Flexbox to layout the website.

Not gonna lie, I cheated on the header icon dots as I looked on a fellow completed project. I also felt like I cheated since I used an Image as the Header Nav logged in button. This two thing are functionalities to add in the future.

Thanks to everyone of Odin Project.
